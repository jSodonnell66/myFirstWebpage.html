     <h2>Ragu Bolognese</h2>
    
     <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    
        <li>1 large stalk celery, chopped</li>
    
        <li>1 large carrot, chopped</li>
    
        <li>1/2 pound ground chuck</li>
    
        <li>1/4 pound ground pork</li>
    
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
    
        <li>Grating of whole nutmeg</li>
    
        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
    
        <li>1 1/2 cups canned plum tomatoes, cut up with their juice.</li>
     </ul>
    
     <ol>
    
    <li>In a large saucepan or deep skillet, heat the oil and butter over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the celery and carrots continue to cook until vegetables begin to get tender, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>Add the ground beef and a large pinch of salt and pepper. Break up the ground meat with a spoon or fork as you stir. Cook until all traces of pink are gone from the meat. 3. Add the milk and let it simmer gently until it has completely evaporated, stirring occasionally. Add a grating of nutmeg.</li>
    
    <li> Add the white wine and continue to simmer until it is evaporated. Add the tomatoes and their juice, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer. Cook the ragu for at least 3 hours, uncovered. The sauce is done when all the liquid has evaporated and you can see the oil separate from the sauce.</li>
    
    <li>Check the seasoning and cool until ready to use.</li>
    
     </ol>
